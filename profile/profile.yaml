summary: "I pursued a degree in Natural Science with a concentration in Chemistry at the University of Calgary. After that I decided to switch gears and got a diploma in Dance Education from the University of Surrey in London. After several years of teaching, I wanted to expand my knowledge and career and recieved a  diploma  in Object Oriented Software Development at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. It exposed me to a wide array of concepts, languages, and technologies, such as C#, Java, Python, and SQL, Visual Basic, JavaFX, Android, and MS SQL Server. I loved the variety inherent in programming and the constantly evolving nature of it. Most recently, I joined Jarvis as a Software Engineer where I completed industry relevant projects using Java, SQL, Docker, Linux, and more. As a former ballet dancer and teacher, I find the combmination of creativity and technical aspects when solving problems to be wonderfully familiar and satisfying. Over the past 10+ years I have pursued various educational avenues and have realized that I love learning and expanding my knowledge, and what better career is there for constantly learning, evolving, and growing than computer programming?"

    description: "Designed a Linux monitoring agent that enables a user to monitor and store machine specific information. In order to gather and monitor hardware specification and usage data, this program has 2 bash scripts. The host_info.sh script gathers the host's hardware info once, while the host_usage.sh script monitors resource usage every minute using crontab. Both of these scripts automatically insert the data into a PostgreSQL database (host_agent). This program also includes some sql scripts that make some hypothetical business queries to better monitor cluster usage."
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
# Keywords: Java 8, JDBC, RDBMS, SQL, CRUD,DAO
    description:
      - "JDBC App: Implemented an app that connects to an RDBMS using JDBC and PostgreSQL. Through this app you can create, update, and delete a customer in the database, as well as find and sort a list of customers. It also allows you to find an order by ID and, using a stored procedure, get orders by customer ID. Docker and Maven were used in the development of this project."
# Keywords: Java 8, Lambda, Stream API, IntelliJ
      - "Grep App: Developed a Java app that mimics the function of the Linux grep app. It takes three arguments: the pattern to be searched for (regex), the root directory path (rootPath), and the output file name (outFile). It uses the given directory path to recursively search through the directory and all its subdirectories for any matches to the provided regular expression within any file found there. It then writes all lines that contain the pattern to the outFile. Maven was used to manage the project, and Docker was used to create and share the image."

    #project name
  - name: "Website for Travel Agency"
    description: "Created a protoype website using html/CSS, bootstrap, php, node.js, C#/Visual Basic, and ASP.NET for a travel agency that connected to a Microsoft SQL Server database. It listed both available packages and agencies/agents that were read from a database. Customers were able to fill out an order form which would result in the creation of a customer record and booking record in the database. The form data was sent to an ASP.NET page that verified the data and either re-displayed the form with appropriate error messages or created a customer record if all fields were valid. The website also incuded a customer sign in page that allowed customers to view and update their information (changes were reflected in database). Finally, customers could view a list of their travel packages, including a price breakdown of each package, and the total cost owing."
  - name: "Travel Agency Agent GUI"
    description: "There were two implementations of this project. The first was using C# and Visual Basics and the second used Java and JavFX: Designed an application that provided a Graphical User Interface for viewing and modifying data in a Microsoft SQL Server database using C# and Visual Basic. It allowed agents to add and edit travel packages, as well as select from a product list to add to the package. Agents were able to add and edit other tables in the database. All data was validated using regular expressions. The second implementation of the GUI allowed agents to view and modify data in the same database, but using Java and JavaFX. Users were able to add, modify, and delete customer rewards, rewards, and reward sponsors. All changes were refelcted in the database."
  - name: "Travel Agency Web service"
    description: "Developed a RESTful web service that takes a GET request from a webpage and pulls data from the database to send a response back. It was also able to take a PUT, POST, and DELETE request in order to update the database. The web service was able to take JSON requests and send the data back in the appropriate format. AJAX was used to communicate with the web service from a web page."
  - name: "Travel Agency Android application"
    description: "Designed an Android app that worked with the Travel Agency Web service project. It allowed potential clients to maintain and dsiplay their personal data from the Microsoft SQL Server database. The app was able to access the RESTfule web service created previously and submitted requsests to acess and modify data. It was able to dsiplay, update, insert, and delete data from the database using the REST service endpoints."
