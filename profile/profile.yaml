# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Hello, I am Alishea Armand. I initially pursued a degree in Natural Science with a concentration in Chemistry at the University of Calgary. After that I decided to switch gears and got a diploma in Dance Education from the University of Surrey in London, and then another diploma  in Object Oriented Software Development at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. Because it is a fast track program, you hit the ground running! It exposed me to a wide array of concepts, languages, and technologies. I loved the variety inherent in programming and the constantly evolving nature of it. As a former ballet dancer and teacher, I find the combination of creativity and technical aspects when solving problems to be wonderfully familiar and satisfying. Over the past 10+ years I have pursued various educational avenues and have realized that I love learning and expanding my knowledge, and what better career is there for constantly learning, evolving, and growing than computer programming?
